//        In JavaScript, operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, values, or expressions. Operators are fundamental to performing computations, manipulating values, and controlling the flow of code.here are the main types of operator in java script.
    
//     Arithmetic operators:
//      1- +(Addition)
//      2- *(multiplication)
//      3- -(substraction)
//      4- '/'(division)
//      5- % (modulus) <br>

//     Assignment Operators:
//      1- = (Assignment)
//      2- +=, -=, *=, /= (Compound assignment) 

//     Comparison Operators:
//      1- == (Equality)
//      2- === (Strict equality)
//      3- != or !== (Inequality)
//      4- > (Greater than)
//      5- < (Less than)
//      6- >= (Greater than or equal to)
//      7- <= (Less than or equal to) 

//     Logical Operators:
//      1- && (Logical AND)
//      2- || (Logical OR)
//      3- ! (Logical NOT)     
    

//     -:why operators are essential in programming:-
//        1:- Performing Operations:
//            Operators allow you to perform various operations on data, such as arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), string concatenation, bitwise manipulation, and more. They are fundamental for manipulating values and performing computations
//        2:- Assigning Values:
//            Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They play a key role in storing and updating data within a program. Compound assignment operators provide a concise way to modify a variable's value based on its current value.
           
//        3:- Logical Operations:
//            Logical operators help in making decisions based on multiple conditions. They are vital for implementing logical expressions and controlling the flow of a program through conditions such as AND, OR, and NOT.
//        4:- Type Checking:
//            Unary operators like typeof allow you to check the data type of a value. This is useful for ensuring that the expected types of data are being used in your program.
