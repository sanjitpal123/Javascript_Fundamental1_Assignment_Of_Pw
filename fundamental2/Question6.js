    //     Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
    //     
    //         Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial in JavaScript for several reasons. It significantly enhances code readability, makes the code more maintainable, and helps other developers (or even yourself) understand the purpose and functionality of variables. Clear identifiers contribute to the overall quality of the codebase and promote good coding practices.

    //         Importance of Meaningful Variable Names:

    //         1:-Readability: Descriptive variable names make the code more readable by providing information about the purpose or content of the variable. This is especially important when revisiting code or when sharing it with other developers.

    //         2:-Understanding: Clear identifiers aid in understanding the logic and flow of the code. When variable names accurately reflect their role in the program, it becomes easier to grasp the intention behind different operations.

    //         3:-Maintenance: Code maintenance is simplified when variables have meaningful names. Developers can more easily identify areas that need modification, fix bugs, or extend functionality without having to decipher obscure or cryptic identifiers.

    //         4:-Collaboration: When working in a team, using meaningful variable names facilitates collaboration. Team members can quickly comprehend each other's code, leading to more effective communication and reduced chances of misinterpretation.

    //         Example: Improving Code Readability with Descriptive Variable Names:

    //         Consider the following example where the variable names are not very descriptive:
    //         let x = 10;
    //         let y = 5;
    //         let z = x + y;
    //         console.log(z);
    //         In this case, the purpose of the variables x, y, and z is not immediately clear. Now, let's use more descriptive names:

    //         let baseNumber = 10;
    //         let increment = 5;
    //         let sum = baseNumber + increment;
    //         console.log(sum); 

    //         By using meaningful variable names (baseNumber, increment, sum), it becomes evident that the code is performing addition, and the purpose of each variable is clear. This clarity improves readability and makes the code more self-explanatory.

    //         Best Practices for Naming Variables:

    //         1:-Use descriptive names that convey the purpose or content of the variable.
    //         2:-Avoid overly generic names like temp or data unless their context is evident.
    //         3:-Be consistent in your naming conventions throughout the codebase.
    //         4:-Favor camelCase for variables (myVariableName) in JavaScript.
    //         5:-Consider the readability of your code for future maintainers.
    //         In summary, choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is a simple yet effective practice that significantly contributes to code quality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate on.
