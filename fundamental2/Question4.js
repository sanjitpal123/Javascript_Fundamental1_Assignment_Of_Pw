    //     Declaring variables in JavaScript is a fundamental concept that allows developers to store and manipulate data in their programs. Variables act as named containers for values, making it easier to reference and modify data throughout the code. The let keyword is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript.

    //     1:-Purpose of Declaring Variables:

    //     2:-Storage of Data: Variables provide a way to store and hold values, such as numbers, strings, or objects, within a program.

    //     3:-Memory Allocation: When a variable is declared, the JavaScript engine allocates memory to store the value associated with that variable.

    //     4:-Identification and Naming: Variables enable developers to give meaningful names to data, making the code more readable and self-explanatory.

    //     5:-Data Manipulation: Variables allow for the manipulation of data by performing operations, calculations, and transformations on the stored values.

    //     6:-Scope Control: Variables have a scope, determining where in the code they can be accessed. This helps in managing the visibility and accessibility of data.

    //     Declaring Variables with the 'let' Keyword:
    //     The let keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. Here's the basic syntax:

    //     javascript
    //         let variableName;
    //         Example 1: Declaration without Initialization:

    //     javascript
        
    //         let age;
    //         Example 2: Declaration with Initialization:

    //     javascript
    
    //         let name = "John";
    //         In the first example, the variable age is declared without being assigned a value. It is initially undefined. In the second example, the variable name is declared and initialized with the string value "John."
    //         Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces {}) in which they are defined. This is in contrast to the var keyword, which has a function scope.
