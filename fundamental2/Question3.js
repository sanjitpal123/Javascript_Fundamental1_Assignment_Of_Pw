//     
//         1:- String:

//                 Description: Strings represent sequences of characters. They are used to store and manipulate text.
//                 Example:
//                 javascript
//                 Copy code
//                 let greeting = "Hello, World!";

//         2:- Number:

//                 Description: Numbers represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
//                 Example:
//                 javascript
//                 Copy code
//                 let age = 25;
//                 let price = 9.99;

//         3:- Boolean:

//                 Description: Booleans represent logical values, either true or false. They are often used in conditional statements.
//                 Example:
//                 javascript
//                 Copy code
//                 let isRaining = false;

//         4:- Null:

//                 Description: The null value represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable or object has no value or is uninitialized.
//                 Example:
//                 javascript
//                 Copy code
//                 let myVar = null;

//         5:- Undefined:

//                 Description: The undefined value is assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized with a value.
//                 Example:
//                 javascript
//                 Copy code
//                 let x;
//                 console.log(x);  // Output: undefined
//         These primitive data types are atomic and immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed directly. When you perform operations that seem to modify these values, you are often creating new values rather than modifying the original ones. Additionally, these primitive types are stored by value, meaning each variable stores a copy of the actual value.
