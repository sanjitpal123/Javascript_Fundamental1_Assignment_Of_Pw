    //     
    //         Comments in JavaScript are textual annotations within the code that are not executed or interpreted by the JavaScript engine. They serve the purpose of providing additional information, explanations, and context for developers who read and maintain the code. Proper use of comments enhances code readability, facilitates collaboration, and helps in documenting the codebase.

    //         Importance of Comments in JavaScript:

    //         1:-Code Explanation: Comments allow developers to explain the purpose, logic, or functionality of a particular section of code. This is especially useful for complex algorithms or non-trivial solutions.

    //         2;-Documentation: Comments serve as a form of documentation for the codebase. They provide insights into the usage and behavior of functions, variables, or modules, making it easier for others (or even the original developer) to understand and work with the code.

    //         3:-Debugging and Troubleshooting: Comments can be used to temporarily disable or comment out portions of code for debugging purposes. This allows developers to isolate and identify issues more efficiently.

    //         4:-Code Review: Comments are valuable during code reviews, helping other developers to understand the intentions behind certain decisions and ensuring that coding standards and best practices are followed.

    //         Examples of Single-line and Multi-line Comments:

    //         Single-line Comment:

    //         Use // to create a single-line comment. Everything following // on that line is treated as a comment.
    //         javascript example
    //         // This is a single-line comment
    //         let age = 25;  // This comment explains the purpose of the variable
    //         Multi-line Comment:

    //         Use /* */ to create a multi-line comment. Everything between /* and */ is treated as a comment, even if it spans multiple lines.
    //         javascript
    //         /*
    //         This is a multi-line comment.
    //         It provides additional information about a block of code.
    //         */
    //         function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    //         return price * quantity;
    //         }

    //         Best Practices for Using Comments:

    //         1:-Be Concise: Keep comments concise and to the point. Avoid unnecessary or redundant comments that do not add value.

    //         2:-Update Comments: Regularly review and update comments as the code evolves. Outdated comments can be misleading and lead to confusion.

    //         3:-Avoid Over-commenting: Code should be self-explanatory to some extent. Avoid over-commenting on straightforward and obvious code blocks.

    //         4:-Follow a Consistent Style: Adopt a consistent style for writing comments across the codebase. Consistency improves readability and makes the codebase more maintainable.
